# Server-side Api's challenge: Weather dashboard by Juan Martinez
* For this challenge we had to use the weather API to dynamically change the HTML and CSS based on the information that we get from the server API. The code I used for this challenge is HTML/CSS and JavaScript. I started the code from scratch, I also used bootstrap CSS for the buttons and the form tag.
